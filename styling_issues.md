# Geolox Website Styling Issues Analysis

## Identified Issues:

1. **Missing Tailwind CSS Processing**: The website appears to be using basic styling without proper Tailwind CSS compilation. The custom CSS variables are defined but Tailwind utilities may not be properly processed.

2. **Layout Issues**: 
   - The content appears to be displaying but without proper spacing and styling
   - Text appears to be using default browser styles rather than the custom design system

3. **Component Styling**: 
   - Buttons and interactive elements are not properly styled
   - Cards and sections lack the modern styling defined in globals.css

4. **Typography Issues**:
   - Text is not using the custom font families defined in the config
   - Gradient text effects are not being applied

5. **Color Scheme Issues**:
   - The dark theme variables are defined but not being applied consistently
   - Brand colors from Tailwind config are not being used

## Root Cause Analysis:
The main issue appears to be that Tailwind CSS is not being properly compiled or the build process is not including the necessary CSS processing. The globals.css file contains comprehensive styling but it's not being applied effectively.

## Next Steps:
1. Check Tailwind CSS configuration and build process
2. Ensure PostCSS is properly configured
3. Verify that all necessary dependencies are installed
4. Fix any compilation issues
5. Test the styling fixes
